            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You are a clinical social worker in a very small, rural community. You are one of only two mental health providers in the county; the other provider is currently not accepting new patients.</p>
            <p>A new client, Mr. Miller, comes to you for help with severe anxiety related to a pending divorce. During the intake assessment, Mr. Miller mentions that he is the head coach of the local girls' soccer team. You realize immediately that your 14-year-old daughter is on that specific team. Mr. Miller does not yet know that you are the parent of one of his players.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller becomes emotional during the session, disclosing that he often feels "angry and resentful" toward the parents of the players, feeling they judge him too harshly. He specifically mentions that he is worried about "keeping his cool" at the upcoming tournament this weekend. You are planning to attend that tournament to watch your daughter.</p>

            <p>During today's session, David appears significantly more agitated than usual. He has stopped taking his medication. He tells you, "I drove past Sarah's house last night. I saw her with another guy. I swear, if I see them together again, I’m going to make sure neither of them ever walks again. I bought a gun yesterday, and I have it in my truck right now."</p>
            <p>When you ask David if he intends to use the gun, he looks at you intensely and says, "I'm done being the victim. They'll get what they deserve tonight."</p>
